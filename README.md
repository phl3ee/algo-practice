# Algo Practice

Just revisting python with algo practice from leetcode etc

Some of these are not unit tested, I just copied my solutions off the platform to have them locally, after setting up a local dev environment.

Run tests from root directory like this:

```python
 python -m unittest tests.test_twoSum
```
